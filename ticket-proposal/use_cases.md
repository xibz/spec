# Ticket Events Use Cases

1. Engineering teams usually start with some ticket or issue that allows for
   features to be implemented or at least begin the engineering process.
    - This allows management or engineers to start at the ticket and follow
      life cycle of the actual feature.
    - Further this allows us to work backwards from an artifact to the ticket  
2. Allows for metrics regarding tickets, e.g. how many bugs occurred this
   month, how many were fixed, etc.
    - How efficiently are we addressing our customers needs? As in when ticket
      was created to resolved.
3. Out of scope, but was talked about internally at Apple, is that why not
   standardize ticket APIs?
